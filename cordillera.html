                        </div>
                        <p>For 2,000 years, the high rice fields of the Ifugao have followed the contours of the mountains. The fruit of knowledge handed down from one generation to the next, and the expression of sacred traditions and a delicate social balance, they have helped to create a landscape of great beauty that expresses the harmony between humankind and the environment.</p>
                        <div class = "subtitle">
                            <h2>How is it preserved?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are authentic in form, character, and function as a direct result of the 2000 year-old and continuously maintained regime that balances climatic, geographical, ecological, agronomic, ethnographic, religious, social, economic, political and other factors.  Through ritual practices, chants and symbols which emphasize ecological balance, the Ifugao community has maintained the intactness of the terraces’ traditional management system over this long period of time, ensuring the authenticity of both the original landscape engineering and the traditional wet-rice agriculture. Once this balance is disturbed the whole system begins to collapse, but so long as they all operate together harmoniously, as they have over two millennia, the authenticity is total.

                            Being a living cultural landscape, evolutionary changes continuously fine-tune and adapt the cultural response of the terraces’ owners and inhabitants in response to changing climatic, social, political and economic conditions. However, the fact that the Ifugao community continues to occupy, use and maintain their ancestral lands in the age-old traditional manner ensures appreciation and awareness of the enduring value of these traditional practices which continue to sustain them.
                            
                            Nevertheless the reduction in the workforce and other social and environmental factors, including changes in management of the watershed forests, makes this traditional system and thus the overall balance highly vulnerable and requires sustained management and conservation.</p>

                    <h2>History of Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras</h2>
                    <div class ="review-container">
                        <p>The Banaue Rice Terraces, often dubbed as the "Eighth Wonder of the World," are a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the Ifugao people in the Philippines. Carved into the Cordillera Mountains of northern Luzon over 2,000 years ago, these terraces are believed to have been built by hand, using rudimentary tools and sheer determination. The terraces were meticulously crafted to follow the contours of the mountains, maximizing space for rice cultivation in a region with rugged terrain.

                            Constructed without the aid of modern technology, the Banaue Rice Terraces are a marvel of ancient engineering and are often referred to as the "stairway to the heavens" due to their resemblance to giant steps reaching towards the sky. They are not only a source of livelihood for the Ifugao people but also a symbol of their cultural heritage and connection to the land.
                            
                            Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995, the Banaue Rice Terraces stand as a living testament to the sustainable agricultural practices of the Ifugao people and serve as a reminder of the importance of preserving traditional knowledge and environmental conservation. Despite the challenges posed by modernization and climate change, efforts are being made to ensure the preservation and protection of this cultural treasure for future generations to admire and appreciate.</p>
