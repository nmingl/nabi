                        For beginners, the gentle rollers of San Juan Beach provide the perfect training ground.

Imagine carving graceful turns on your board, feeling the spray of the ocean on your face and the exhilarating power of the wave propelling you forward.</p>

                    <p>Step back in time and immerse yourself in history with a visit to the 400-year-old Baluarte Watch Tower, a hidden gem nestled within the charming town of Luna. This sentinel of the sea stands proudly along the beach coast, a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of a bygone era. Built by the Spaniards during their colonial rule, the Baluarte served as a vigilant eye, scanning the horizon for approaching threats – pirates, invaders, anything that could disrupt the tranquility of the town.

                        Imagine the Spanish guards perched atop the tower, squinting through the midday sun, their weathered faces etched with determination. Picture the frantic signals relayed from the watchtower during the Second World War, a crucial communication hub in the face of conflict.  The very stones whisper tales of battles fought and won, of communities protected and lives saved.</p>
