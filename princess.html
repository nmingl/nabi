                        </div>
                        <p>This park features a spectacular limestone karst landscape with an underground river. One of the river's distinguishing features is that it emerges directly into the sea, and its lower portion is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full 'mountain-to-sea' ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia.</p>
                        <div class = "subtitle">
                            <h2>How is it preserved?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The property, including the karst mountain landscapes and the underground river, is in excellent condition. Integrity of the property is also expressed in the complete "mountain-to-the-sea" ecosystem that protects one of the most significant forests in Asia. The uniqueness of the mangrove forests in the Bay along with the flora and fauna they harbour, and the bioecological connection with the caves and surrounding forest is protected within the core area of the property ensuring the local key inter-related and inter-dependant elements of their natural relationships are protected.

                            The Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park, comprising 22,202 ha and covering three barangays, encompasses the natural values of the property and is of adequate size to protect all the various landforms and the estuarine ecosystem that conveys the Outstanding Universal Value of the property. The boundaries of the property cover the entire watershed of the underground river, thus protecting water quality and quantity and ensuring the long-term viability of the outstanding natural values contained within the property. The biodiversity values of the property are highlighted in Barangay Marufinas which is included in the property along with the adjacent barangays which also contain significant biodiversity values and habitats important to their integrity. Management guidelines are needed to address threats to the property including pollutants impacting on water quality in the underground river. Threats to the property are mainly from adverse activities in adjacent catchment areas, primarily forest clearing and agricultural activities. Tourism activities require careful planning and management to ensure the natural values are not impacted.</p>

                    <h2>History of Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park</h2>
                    <div class ="review-container">
                        <p>The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, located in Palawan, Philippines, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New7Wonders of Nature. It features a stunning underground river system that winds its way through limestone caves before flowing directly into the South China Sea. This subterranean river is one of the longest navigable underground rivers in the world, with portions accessible to visitors by boat.

                            The park is renowned for its exceptional biodiversity, housing a diverse range of flora and fauna, including endemic species such as the Palawan peacock-pheasant and the Palawan hornbill. Its unique ecosystem also includes limestone cliffs, pristine forests, and a coastal mangrove forest, providing habitat for a variety of wildlife.
                            
                            In addition to its natural beauty, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park holds cultural significance as a sacred site for indigenous communities such as the Batak tribe, who have long revered the area as a place of spiritual importance.
                            
                            Designated as a national park in 1971 and later inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park serves as a prime example of successful conservation efforts in the Philippines. Through sustainable tourism practices and community involvement, stakeholders aim to protect this natural wonder while promoting environmental awareness and supporting local livelihoods.</p>
