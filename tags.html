                    </div>
                    <p>If you’ve never been to Tagaytay, People’s Park in the Sky has to be on your itinerary.  This historic landmark isn't just about the view, it's also a unique blend of natural beauty and a fascinating piece of Philippine history.

                        One of the most popular Tagaytay tourist spots, People's Park in the Sky offers a bird's-eye view unlike any other.  Gaze out at the sprawling highlands of Tagaytay, lush and green, dotted with pine trees.  Then your eyes are drawn to the centerpiece - the iconic Taal Lake.  Take in the majesty of the Taal Volcano rising from the center of the lake, a picture-perfect image that will stay with you long after your visit.
                        
                        But People's Park in the Sky offers more than just a scenic vista.  For a mere P50 entrance fee, you'll also be stepping into a bit of Philippine history.  The park was originally conceived as a grand mansion, the "Palace in the Sky," commissioned during the Marcos era.  Construction began in the 1980s, but was halted due to political events.  The unfinished shell of the mansion still stands today, a unique feature of the park that adds to its historical charm. </p>
