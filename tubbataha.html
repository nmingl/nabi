                        </div>
                        <p>The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 96,828 ha, including the North and South Atolls and the Jessie Beazley Reef. It is a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100-m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.</p>

                            <h2>How is it preserved?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The property comprises two atolls (North and South Atoll) and an emergent coral cay, Jessie Beazley Reef. It includes open sea with an average depth of 750 m and still displays a well preserved marine ecosystem with top predators, and a large number and diversity of coral reef and pelagic species. The property also hosts an important population of resident, nesting and feeding seabirds. The area is free of human habitation and activities and is of a sufficient size to maintain associated biological and ecological processes. The property is of an adequate size to ensure the complete representation of the key features and processes of the reef systems within it, although the maintenance of these values also requires measures to be taken outside the boundaries of the property in relation to some migratory species and the buffering of the property from threats to the marine environment that could occur in the wider area. A key aspect of the integrity of the property is the low level of fishing pressure, due to the no-take policies which are in place throughout its area.</p>

                    <h2>History of Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park</h2>
                    <div class ="review-container">
                        <p>The Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, located in the Sulu Sea, Philippines, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the country's most important marine protected areas. Encompassing over 130,000 hectares of pristine coral reefs, it is home to a stunning array of marine biodiversity, including over 600 species of fish, 360 species of corals, 11 species of sharks, and numerous endangered marine species such as green sea turtles and hawksbill turtles.

                            The park's remote location and strict conservation measures have helped preserve its exceptional marine ecosystem, making it a haven for marine life and a world-renowned diving destination. Its crystal-clear waters and vibrant coral reefs attract divers from around the globe, offering a unique opportunity to witness the beauty and diversity of underwater life.
                            
                            Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park also plays a crucial role in marine conservation and scientific research, serving as a marine sanctuary and a vital breeding ground for numerous species of fish and marine mammals. Additionally, it serves as a source of livelihood for local communities through sustainable eco-tourism initiatives and supports efforts to raise awareness about marine conservation and the importance of preserving fragile ecosystems like coral reefs.
                            
                            Despite the challenges posed by climate change, illegal fishing, and other threats, the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park continues to thrive as a symbol of hope for marine conservation, demonstrating the importance of protecting and preserving our oceans for future generations.</p>
