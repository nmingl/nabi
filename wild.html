                        </div>
                        <p>Forming a mountain ridge running north-south along the Pujada Peninsula in the south-eastern part of the Eastern Mindanao Biodiversity Corridor, the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary has an elevation range of 75 to 1,637 m above sea level and provides critical habitat for a range of plant and animal species. The property showcases terrestrial and aquatic habitats at different elevations, and includes threatened and endemic flora and fauna species, eight of which are found only at Mount Hamiguitan. These include critically endangered trees, plants and the iconic Philippine eagle and Philippine cockatoo.</p>
                        <div class = "subtitle">
                            <h2>How is it preserved?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The property is substantially intact and of adequate size to provide for the conservation of its biodiversity and other natural resources. It remains well preserved and intact as evidenced by the results of studies and ongoing monitoring. The Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary protects typical mountain ecosystems of the biogeographic region and include the agro-ecosystem, dipterocarp, montane, mossy, and mossy-pygmy forests. These ecosystems harbour an assemblage of endemic, rare and economically important flora and fauna. The level of vegetative cover indicates that the property is in relatively pristine condition with its surface area covered by a mix of closed and open canopy forest and smaller areas of brush land. The terrestrial and aquatic habitats are well preserved and a number of globally threatened and endemic species rely on or occur within the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary. The Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuaryâ€™s marked vertical zonation of vegetation and associated habitats makes it particularly vulnerable to climate change impact. </p>

                    <h2>History of Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
                    <div class ="review-container">
                        <p>The Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the province of Davao Oriental, Philippines, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a designated ASEAN Heritage Park. It is renowned for its unique and diverse ecosystem, which includes a rich array of flora and fauna found nowhere else in the world. The sanctuary is home to the iconic pygmy forest, characterized by miniature trees and plants, as well as rare and endemic species such as the Philippine eagle, Philippine tarsier, and various pitcher plants.

                            Mount Hamiguitan's significance extends beyond its biodiversity. It also holds cultural and historical value, serving as a sacred site for indigenous communities such as the Mandaya and Manobo tribes, who consider the mountain as a place of worship and ancestral heritage.
                            
                            Designated as a protected area in 2004, the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary showcases the importance of conservation efforts in preserving unique ecosystems and cultural heritage. Through sustainable management practices and community engagement, stakeholders aim to safeguard this natural treasure for future generations to appreciate and enjoy while promoting ecotourism as a means of supporting local livelihoods and raising awareness about the importance of biodiversity conservation.</p>
